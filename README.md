## Short Description
My realization of match game. The game is often used to train your memory. The playing field consists of cards with different patterns on the back. Before the start of the game session, the player is shown the location of all paired cards, after 10 seconds they are hidden. The victory is counted when all pairs of cards are found.

## Screenshots

## Features
1. You can switch between 3 pages - about game, best score, settings. 
2. About game page have a brief instruction on how to start the game. Best score page includes top 10 players which is stores in IndexedDB. And on the settings page you have two options - type of cards and the complexity of the game.
3. When you click on the Start game button, the timer will start counting and you need to remember the location of the pairs of cards on the field. After 10 seconds, the cards will turn over and you will need to find all pairs of cards.
4. After the game finish, a popup appears and the player is given the opportunity to register in order to get in score page.
